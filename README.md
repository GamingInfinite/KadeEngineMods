# Kade Engine Mods
This is a public repository for all of my mods for Kade Engine using their recently implemented ModCore.

### Disclaimer
This is a fan project for unofficial ports of mods while we wait for ModCore to get more developed and for devs to update their mods for the new system.  If you're are one of said devs, and don't want my recreation of your mod (using your assets, music, whatnot), please leave an issue on the issue page, and I'll remove it as soon as I see it.

### IMPORTANT
If you, yeah you, reading this, have Adobe flash/animate/whatever, or some way of properly editing .fla files without paying for adobe, please, please, PLEASE, see if you can workshop and massage any of the sprites for Imposter and Bob & Bosip, because the sprites (for Imposter 1 and 2, and Bob (bob cameo)) aren't sitting in the correct spot.  I'm playing around with offsets to try and fix it but it's a work in progress.

## About
This is for both my ports and actual mod projects of my own, for when I make them.  Download links are below.

### Install
1. Click the download button for the ```.zip``` file
2. Extract the contents of the ```.zip``` for the downloaded mod to the following path: ```<Kade Engine Path>/mods```
    - Path should end up looking like ```<Kade Engine Path>/mods/<Mod Name>```
3. Open Kade Engine and the mods will load automatically.
